    NOTICE OF SEIZURE

During an inspection on the 23rd of May 2025, at 18:19 Basin Time, an unlawful waystone was seized by the Praetor Signorum at Hellas Basin Station pursuant to the Warp Magic Act 2025.

This waystone was discovered approximately 27 hours earlier, at which time notice was sent via mail that it must be surrendered within 24 hours.

The Consul Transportorum has been informed of your failure to comply with the notice and may choose to press charges.

As no other waystones have been surrendered to the DoT, but were not located during this inspection, I have advised the Consul to begin a full inspection into Hellas Basin's noncompliance with the Warp Magic Act.

Signed,
Praetor Signorum
Ryukyu
