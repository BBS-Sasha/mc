Dear Consul Transportorum,

I write to inquire regarding the activities of your department with regards to the rail network.

In the last sitting of Parliament, you stated that the department intended to work with local lords to increase train routes and frequency.

Are there any plans to do so in the near future?

Further, are there any plans for department-operated trains on common routes, so that people can more easily travel with the recent warp magic ban, or will train routes be determined entirely by private citizens?

Thank you,
Lady of the Ryukyus
