Dear Consul Transportorum,

As Lord Speaker of His Majesty's House of Lords, it is my duty to convey a complaint submitted to the House by three of its Lords regarding the activities of your department.

Their Lordships have expressed their displeasure with the department's recent notice regarding the commencment of the Warp Magic Act 2025 which received parliamentary assent in the sitting of the House of Lords on the Ninth of March, in the 1st year of His Majesty's Reign.

The notice states, "Any sharestones crafted by citizens also need to be declared."

It is the opinion of Their Lordships that this requirement oversteps the rights and requirements set forth in the Warp Magic Act, and that such a request is a violation of the privacy and autonomy of Their Lordships.

They therefore request that the department issues a retraction of this requirement, either permamently or until provision is passed in the House of Lords making it lawful.

Sincerely,
Lady of the Ryukyus
Lord Speaker
