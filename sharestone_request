Dear Consul Transportorum,

I would like to formally request five pink sharestones to replace the waystones currently in use.

I require a sharestone for the following locations:
- Okinawa
- Sesoko Island
- St Cecilia's Basilica
- Glowstone Drill
- Gold Drill

Please deliver these to Japan Home at your earliest convenience.
