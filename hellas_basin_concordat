Your Lordship,

Her Holiness pleased to propose a Concordat (a diplomatic agreement with the church) with the following terms:

The Church would like:
- For Your Lordship to profess the Venilian faith
- A church in Your Lordship's territory
- Legislative support should it be needed

The Church is prepared to offer:
- The title of Bishp in the Diocese of Hellas Basin
- Use of a papal apartment

Please send your response to PONMAX via post. If you would like to alter any terms, make an alternative proposition, request a different title, etc. Her Holiness is open to discussion.
