Your Lordship,

It is my pleasure to inform you that St Cecilia's Basilica has now completed construction.

The Basilica is a place of worship, a home to the Popess, the See of the Popess, and the headquarters of the Venilian Church. Any questions regarding the Venilian faith may be sent their at the address PONMAX (Pontifex Maxima), and Her Holiness will address them as soon as she can.

Visitors are always welcome at the Basilica. Those wishing to visit may board the Papostar at Spawn Station (southbound), and enjoy a fast and comfortable journey to St Cecilia's Square. Visitors who wish to arrive by plane are requested to land in St Cecilia's Square (the wide part to the south) and not block the walkway between the Square and the Basilica.

If you would like a tour from Her Holiness, please let her know whenever she is online, and she will be happy to guide you around this great cathedral.

If you would like to visit the upper areas of the Basilica, a lift can be found in the pillar to your right as you enter. Please do not close the doors if the lift is on the lower floor, and please refrain from entering the area retricted by the Dicastery of Energy.

Included in this parcel, you will find the formal announcement of Her Holiness's papacy and an introduction to the Venilian faith. Her Holiness is in the process of discovering and decipering the ancient texts, and once she has completed a translation, a full holy book will be mailed to you.

We pray your visits will be pleasant.

Caecilia IX PP
Dicastery of Communications
